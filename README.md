# CarbonEye - A Watchful Eye on Highway Carbon Output

## Objective:
The CarbonEye project aims to analyze vehicle activity on highways to estimate CO₂ emissions, providing actionable insights into transportation's contribution to air pollution. By utilizing advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques, the system identifies, counts vehicles, and calculates their carbon footprint based on recorded data.

## Key Features:

### Vehicle Detection and Counting:

Employs YOLOv8 for real-time, high-accuracy detection and classification of vehicles in video footage.
Counts vehicles passing through a highway segment, categorized by type.

### CO₂ Emissions Estimation:

Uses the formula:
CO₂ Emissions =(Total Distance/Fuel Efficiency)*Emission Factor

Integrates fuel efficiency averages and CO₂ emission factors to provide accurate calculations.
Outputs total emissions in kilograms, offering insights into the environmental impact.

### User-Friendly Interface:

Simple upload of MP4 video files for analysis.
Input field to specify highway length for precise estimations.
Intuitive dashboard for viewing results, including vehicle counts and CO₂ emissions.
